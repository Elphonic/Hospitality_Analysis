## Problem Statement

AtliQ Grands, a prominent five-star hotel chain operating across India for over 20 years, is losing its market share and revenue in the luxury and business hotel categories. This decline is attributed to strategic moves from competitors and ineffective decision-making by the management. 

As a strategic response, AtliQ Grands aims to leverage Business and Data Intelligence to regain their market share and revenue. Without an in-house data analytics team, they have hired a third-party service provider (you, the Data Analyst) to derive actionable insights from their historical data.

## Project Objective

The objective of this project is to create a Power BI dashboard that provides key insights related to:

- Revenue generation
- Market performance across cities and room types
- Booking platform analysis
- Realization percentage
- Trends in key performance metrics
- Cancellations and average ratings

The insights derived will help AtliQ Grands' revenue management team make informed strategic decisions to improve their revenue and market share.
